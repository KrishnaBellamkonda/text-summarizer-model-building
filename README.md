# text-summarizer-model-building

### Description
This repository is a brief outline of the model building and preprocessing steps involved in building the TensorFlow model used in the text-summarizer repository. 

### Functionality 
This simple notebook summarizes the process of creating a very simple BERT based model for extractive summarization. You can run the notebook 
to build and save your own model. 


### Technology 
* Python 

### Packgaes 
* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Hub 
* numpy 
* os

### Additional Ideas 
* This approach can be used with other models such as 'universal-sentence-encoder'
* You can use BERT for other tasks such as Text Classification
